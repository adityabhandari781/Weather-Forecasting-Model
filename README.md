This python program uses the Facebook Prophet library to forecast a parameter of weather, given a dataset consisting of values of temperatures, pressures, etc. on a range of days. 
The output is shown through a tkinter interface, where you may load the dataset, choose the parameter to predict and get the prediction over a period of time. 
This program was made as a part of my 2nd semester college project.
